# Getting Started

## Setup HTML
To get started, embed angular-translate in your HTML document. Of course, this should happen
**after** Angular itself is embedded. Your HTML should look like this:

<pre>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>i18n app</title>

    <script src="path/to/angular.js"></script>
    <script src="path/to/angular-translate.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body ng-app="myApp">

  </body>
</html>
</pre>

## Declaring dependencies
Once this is done, you can declare angular-translate as a dependency of your app.
Angular provides dependency injection, which is awesome. So, to tell your app
that it needs angular-translate to work properly, simply inject
angular-translate as a dependency into your module like shown in the following code.
This gives you access to all components angular-translate comes with.

<pre>
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['pascalprecht.translate']);
</pre>

## Introducing `$translateProvider`

angular-translate is now declared as dependency, which means we now have access
to all of its components. Angular follows a pretty straight forward architecture
when it comes to configuration of different services you might want to use later
in your app. Just take a look at the following code.

Pretty sure, you've already seen something like this:

<pre>
app.config(function ($locationProvider) {
  $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
});
</pre>

Or maybe the configuration of a `$route` service:

<pre>
app.config(function ($routeProvider) {
  $routeProvider.when('/something', {
    templateUrl: 'url/to/template',
    controller: 'SomeFancyCtrl'
  });
});
</pre>

So what actually happens here is not the _use of a certain service_ to configure
some things. Its more the _configuration of a certain service_ using a
_provider_, which happens to be used later in your app. This means,
`$locationProvider.html5Mode(true)` configures the `$location` **service** to
work with html5 mode. So if a service should be configurable from outside,
it needs a corresponding provider that provides the interface you need.

angular-translate comes with a `$translateProvider` that you can use to
configure the provided `$translate` service which handles the i18n stuff in your
app. The `$translate` service is used by directives and filters you can use
through your whole application. To let `$translate` service translate your
contents, it has to know which translations are actually available.

This is where `$translateProvider` comes in. `$translateProvider` provides
methods to teach your app different languages and let `$translate` service
make use of them.

## Teaching your app a language

Teaching your app a language with `$translateProvider` is very easy. First you
have to inject the provider into your module configuration function (which is
the only place where you can access it).

<pre>
app.config(['$translateProvider', function($translateProvider) {

}]);
</pre>

Now, to add a language, you have to make `$translateProvider` know of a
**translation table**. What does that mean? It's actually quite simple.
angular-translate expects translation tables as JSON objects. So all you have
to do, is to represent your translation data as JavaScript hash object, or,
when loading remotely, as a JSON object. This is how a translation table could
look like:

```json
{
  "TRANSLATION_ID": "This is a concrete translation for a specific language."
}
```

Is that easy? The translation table above contains just one translation. As you
can see, the key represents a translation ID, whereas the value represents
the concrete translation for a certain language. You don't even have to provide
any information in your translation table, to which language it corresponds. But
more on that later.

You can also organize your translations by enclosing them inside namespaces.
This is particularly interesting for big websites with many and/or long pages.
All you have to do is to create nested JSON objects:

```json
{
  "NAMESPACE": {
    "SUB_NAMESPACE": {
       "TRANSLATION_ID1": "This is a namespaced translation."
    }
  }
}
```

This translation table only contains one translation, but you can extend it very
easily. You can have various nesting levels in your translation table, and each
namespace can contain as many subnamespace as you want making it very flexible
for you to use!

## Shortcuts and Links
A very neat feature that is available since `1.1.1` is usage of Shortcuts and Links.
Let's say you have a translation table that looks like this:

```json
{
  "bar": {
    "foo": {
      "foo": "This is my text."
    }
  }
}
```

You would later access the existing translation id actually via `bar.foo.foo`.
So, this is pretty much okay, but we can do better. angular-translate is clever
enought to recognize, if there's a translation id that has the same identifier as
its corresponding namespace. If that is the case, you can access the translation id
with a simple shortcut by just pointing to the regarding namespace rather than the
translation id. This is possible, because there can only be one translation id
with the same identifier under the same namespace.

So this basically means, you can access the translation id above with the shortcut
`bar.foo`. Cool, huh?

Another cool feature that angular-translate provides is the ability to link within
your translation table from one translation id to another. Let's say we have the
following translation table:

```json
{
  "SOME_NAMESPACE": {
    "OK_TEXT": "OK"
  },
  "ANOTHER_NAMESPACE": {
    "OK_TEXT": "OK"
  }
}
```

So as you can see we have to introduced namespaces here, but both of them kind of need
a text that probably just says "OK". This case isn't unusual if you just think about
a confirmation button or similar in your app. However, it isn't hard to recognize
that we have a redundancy here and we as developers don't like redundancy right?

If there's a translation id that will always have the same concrete text as another
one you can just link to it. To link to another translation id, all you have to do
is to prefix its contents with an `@:` sign followed by the full name of the
translation id including the namespace you want to link to. So the example above
could look like this:

```json
{
  "SOME_NAMESPACE": {
    "OK_TEXT": "OK"
  },
  "ANOTHER_NAMESPACE": {
    "OK_TEXT": "@:SOME_NAMESPACE.OK_TEXT"
  }
}
```

## Aaaand action!

Let's add a translation table to our app. `$translateProvider` provides a
method called `translations()`, which takes care of that. Let's say we have a
translation table like this:

<pre>
var translations = {
  HEADLINE: 'What an awesome module!',
  PARAGRAPH: 'Srsly!',
  NAMESPACE: {
    PARAGRAPH: 'And it comes with awesome features!'
  }
};
</pre>

We can add this table with the use of `$translateProvider.translations()`:

<pre>
app.config(['$translateProvider', function ($translateProvider) {
  // add translation table
  $translateProvider
    .translations('en', translations)
    .preferredLanguage('en');
}]);
</pre>

This is basically all you have to do. Simply specify a language key and add a
translate table for it. After that tell angular-translate what the preferred
language is. Since we're adding the translation tables at configuration time,
`$translate` service is able to access it, once it is instantiated and used.
Here's the working code:

<doc:example module="myApp">
  <doc:source>
    <script>
      var translations = {
        HEADLINE: 'What an awesome module!',
        PARAGRAPH: 'Srsly!',
        NAMESPACE: {
          PARAGRAPH: 'And it comes with awesome features!'
        }
      };

      var app = angular.module('myApp', ['pascalprecht.translate']);

      app.config(['$translateProvider', function ($translateProvider) {
        // add translation table
        $translateProvider
          .translations('en', translations)
          .preferredLanguage('en');
      }]);
    </script>
    <div>
      <h1>Nothing to see here yet!</h1>
      <p>But we'll change it now</p>
    </div>
  </doc:source>
</doc:example>

Your app is now ready to be localized! In the next chapter, you'll learn how to
use the provided directive and filter by angular-translate, to interpolate
your translations.
